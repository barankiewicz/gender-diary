/* v2: custom gender dimensions hide, never delete (ticket 07, same F17
   rule as tags). Hiding takes a dimension out of everywhere a user picks
   things - presets, the editor, the charts - while its
   entry_dimension_value rows survive, so it needs its own flag: absence
   from every preset cannot say "hidden", because a dimension outside any
   preset still appears in the metric picker. */

/* v3: the search index becomes writable (ticket 09, ADR-0005).

   v1 shaped `entry_fts` but nothing ever wrote to it, and as shipped it
   could not forget a row: a plain contentless FTS5 table only deletes via
   `INSERT INTO entry_fts(entry_fts, rowid, folded_text) VALUES('delete',
   ...)`, which needs the exact text the row was indexed under. Every edit
   would therefore have to re-fold the old note and hope the fold function
   had not changed since - and a mismatch does not fail, it quietly
   decrements token counts that were never there. `contentless_delete=1`
   (SQLite 3.43+; Node ships 3.51.2 and SQLocal's WASM build 3.48.0) makes
   a delete a plain DELETE, so an edit is delete-then-insert.

   FTS5 options cannot be altered, hence the drop and recreate. There is
   nothing to carry across: the index has never held a row.

   Inserts and updates stay in application code because the folding does
   (ADR-0005) and SQL cannot call foldText(). Deletes do not need the
   folded text, so they become a trigger - which is what makes the index
   survive delete paths written later that know nothing about it, ticket
   14's Replace import first among them.

   Entries written before this migration are not in the index. Nothing had
   ever indexed them either, so this loses nothing, but it does mean a
   pre-v3 dev journal has notes that search will not find until they are
   saved again. No release has shipped, so no user is in that position. */
